Nestled beside a gentle stream next to the town square of Highshaw, the mill stands as a testament to the industrious spirit of the villagers. Constructed from sturdy timber beams and local fieldstone, the mill's waterwheel creaks and turns with the flow of the stream, its rhythmic motion echoing the heartbeat of the village. A thatched roof, weathered by years of sun and rain, shelters the modest dwelling attached to the mill, where the miller and their family reside. The proprietor, a weathered figure with calloused hands and a perpetual dusting of flour, is known simply as Old Tomlin. With a twinkle in his eye and a ready smile, Old Tomlin oversees the milling process with practiced expertise, ensuring that each grain brought to his mill is ground to perfection. Inside the mill, the air is thick with the scent of freshly ground flour, and the sound of grinding stones fills the air as they tirelessly transform grain into sustenance for the village. Though the Miller's House and Mill may not boast grandeur or extravagance, its humble presence is woven into the fabric of daily life, providing nourishment and livelihood for the community it serves.
