In the heart of the modest medieval settlement, stands the unassuming structure of the Church of Selune, dedicated to the lunar goddess of peace and navigation. Unlike the grandiose cathedrals that dot the landscapes of larger cities, this humble church embodies simplicity in its design. Constructed from locally sourced timber and unadorned stone, its architecture lacks the intricate carvings and towering spires typical of grand religious edifices. Instead, a single, weathered bell tower rises above the surrounding rooftops, its timeworn bell tolling softly at dusk to mark the passage of time. Inside, the interior is sparse, with plain wooden pews arranged in orderly rows, and a simple altar adorned only with a small, silver crescent moon, symbolizing the divine presence of Selune. Yet, despite its understated appearance, the Church of Selune serves as a beacon of solace and guidance for the villagers, offering prayers and blessings under the gentle glow of the moonlit sky.

If the adventurers wander into the priest's quarters:
In the small chapel dedicated to the lunar goddess Selune, tucked away in a corner of the humble building, lies the simple abode of the resident priest. The room exudes an aura of tranquility, illuminated softly by the gentle glow of moonlight (or sun) filtering in through a small, leaded glass window. A modest bed, adorned with a plain quilt woven from moonlit hues, rests against one wall, its linens neatly arranged in anticipation of restful slumber. A small wooden desk sits nearby, cluttered with parchment scrolls and quill pens, evidence of the priest's diligent study and devotion to his goddess. A solitary candle flickers atop the desk, casting elongated shadows that dance across the room's bare walls, imbuing the space with a sense of sacred serenity. At the north end of the room, a simple altar stands, adorned with a delicate silver crescent moon, a tangible symbol of the priest's unwavering faith and dedication to Selune.

Underneath the altar, is a hidden trap door:
