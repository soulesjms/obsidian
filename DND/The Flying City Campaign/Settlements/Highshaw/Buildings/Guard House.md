Nestled at the edge of Highshaw, the guardhouse stands as a stalwart sentinel, its sturdy stone walls weathered by years of relentless wind and rain. A single, weather-beaten flag bearing the crest of the village flutters atop a creaking wooden pole, signaling the presence of the local watch. The main guard, known as Captain Grissom, is a veteran of countless skirmishes and skirmishes, his weathered features etched with the lines of experience and wisdom. Clad in worn leather armor adorned with dents and scratches from battles long past, Grissom's steely gaze surveys the horizon with a vigilance born of years of service. Despite his gruff exterior, the villagers trust him implicitly, knowing that beneath his weathered exterior lies a heart of unwavering loyalty and courage. Inside the guardhouse, a flickering torch casts dancing shadows upon the rough-hewn walls, while a crude map of the surrounding countryside hangs prominently above a scarred wooden table, a testament to the ceaseless vigilance of those sworn to protect the settlement.
