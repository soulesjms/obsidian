## Flying City Scope
Main idea will be all of the main city will be flying, with a small amount of land outside of the city that's coming with it. I like the idea of there being a few homes/farms that were left behind on the ground, with the possibility of families/loved ones being separated to add to the conflict.

#### Ground Setting (pun intended)
Let's set some ground rules first:
Is flying allowed between the city and ground? 
- Simple answer yes, but only in small inconvenient amounts. Magic is not largely prevalent. I imagine there being a small mages guild with a small handful of magic users skilled enough to fly. 
- I don't want things like airships to be terribly common either. Even if *eventually* the campaign gets to a point where airships are more common, I want that *much* later in the campaign, like after the main starting conflicts are all handled. 
Is Teleportation between the ground and city allowed?
- Similar answer to the above question about flying, but even less common. Flying is one thing, teleportation is even harder/rarer.
Falling?
- Yes, falling is a very simple, very quick way to the ground, AKA death. 
Can the PCs be allowed to leave the city? 
- Yes, but will be discouraged. I don't want the PCs to just leave the city right away. If they do... I'll need to plan a little bit ahead for that. ==TODO: come up with a plan for if PCs leave city and fall.== 
What about a reeeeeeallly long rope?
- I imagine this city being at least a couple thousand feet in the air... not sure a rope would work anyway.
Can you see the ground?
- Yes, but vision of the ground is obscured. In the event that an NPC were to fall/fly to the ground, there would be no immediate way of knowing if they made it safely or not.

## How the city is flying
Possibly idea: City is powered in a similar way to the flying platform in stormlight archive. several gemstones infused with magic that mimic each other's movement. One gemstone is moved one way, while the other is mimics this. hence why the city is lifted. This would mean there's a set of gemstones that were moved in an opposite direction, resulting in the lifting of the city

Idea: ancient ruins underneath the city of a magical folk. Citizens/nobility don't know about this ruin until after the city is flying? Maybe include some reason why the city was founded on top of the ancient city to begin with. This would be a great hook for adventuring because this would provide a main location for the adventurers to begin exploring/encountering monsters, magical treasure etc. I guess doesn't explain how the city is flying though other than it's because of the ancient city.

## State of the city
Since the city is flying, little to no trade is happening outside of the city (unless there's magical means of teleporting/flying)
Little to no natural means of getting water (besides rain?)
Little to no food for the City? Maybe lets say that the city has a royal granary that can help support the city for a while
Because of the scarcity of food and water, banditry and looting (until chapter 1 is completed?)

## Main conflict?
Main conflict will be that the city is at war. This will ultimately mean that the city's nobility/king assumes the city flying is a result of the war. 
Since the city is at war, one thing that could help alleviate concerns is that many of the soldiers were sent to war with the neighboring country?

> [!NOTE] Title
> maybe break up the campaign into chapters: 
> chapter 1 would be finding a way to stabilize the city aka. food water for residents
> chapter 2 would be finding out the cause of the city flying
> chapter 3 would be resolving the city flying - either find a way to land the city, or let it be and find ways to keep it that way (maybe opposing force to try to destry city by crash landing?)


## Quest: Water scarcity
Since the city is flying and most medieval settlements/towns etc. start near a body of water, be it a river or a stream or even by a lake or ocean. If the city is flying, chances are, there's no longer a source of water. A main conflict could be that there is no longer water for its citizens. This could be a simple quest that presents a really big problem.

Problem: City has little to no water now. 
How this manifests: Rivers and springs dried up, wells dried up, aqueducts (if any) dry
Possible solutions: 
	Leave city (flying)
	create the water by magical means (create water spell) 
	transport water from ground(flying)
	conjure water elementals?
	
Quest length: Short(?)

## Quest: Food scarcity
Since the city is flying, there's little to no food. (can this be mitigated with farming once water scarcity is addressed?)


## Random Encounters throughout City

1. Questionable Merchant selling makeshift parachutes "guaranteeing a safe return to the surface." but charging massive amounts of gold for his parachutes. This can be shown by the adventurers walking through the city then seeing an individual jump off a tall building/hill/wall and using the parachute to land "safely". Adventurers then can either convince the individual not to jump off the edge of the city or not, confront the merchant that they're selling bad or ineffective products, or even help the merchant by improving upon their invention and making it more safe. (perhaps even leading to a fetch quest?)
2. NPC faints in the middle of the street and is grabbed by other NPCs. If PCs follow, they are led to an infirmary where a number of NPCs are residing and recouperating due to altitude sickness.


## PCs Gather
The PCs will arrive in the city for some reason (ask the players to have a reason to be in the city as part of their backstory, otherwise getting to the ground may be their main goal). Have an event like a great earthquake occur when the city is lifted into the air. ==TODO: provide some event way for the PCs to gather and form as a party. Possible reasons: ==
- The PCs were asked to come to the city to find out who the enemy spies are from the warring faction
- The PCs gather in response to the city being raised? (doesn't really give a reason for the party to be together)
- ?
