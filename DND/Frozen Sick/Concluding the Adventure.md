You can roll for random encounters on the way back to Syrinlya (see “[Encounters in Eiselcross](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#EiselcrossEncountersLevels14)”), or you can allow the characters an uneventful trip as reward for a job well done. When the characters arrive in Syrinlya, they can arrange for the Buyer to teleport the antidote for frigid woe to Palebank Village. After doing so, the elf pays out the 200 gp reward on behalf of Elro Aldataur.

If the characters don’t successfully recover the frigid woe antidote in time to save Irven and his family, all four family members succumb to the disease. If the characters are successful, they have the thanks of Elro Aldataur, Irven and his family, the people of Palebank Village, and the explorers of Syrinlya.

At the end of this adventure, the characters reach 3rd level. This might mark the beginning of a campaign in the Biting North. In particular, the Buyer suggests that the characters could easily find their fortunes exploring Eiselcross. Alternatively, their success in this mission might inspire the characters to seek out new realms and new adventures elsewhere in Wildemount.
