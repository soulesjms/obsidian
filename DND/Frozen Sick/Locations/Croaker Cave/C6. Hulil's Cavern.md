When the characters can see into this area, read:

> [!NOTE]
> A warm rush of heat comes from a massive fire burning in the center of this cavern, its smoke venting up through a narrow stone chimney. The flames illuminate a rough painting of a five-headed dragon that dominates the north wall. A bedroll is spread out beneath the mural. Near the crackling blaze, a dwarf bundled in a heavy cloak sits on a stone chest beside an elf whose face is covered in dragon tattoos. The dwarf’s face is streaked with pulsing blue veins.

[Hulil Lutan](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744316-hulil-lutan) (a neutral evil, female mountain dwarf [cult fanatic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16836-cult-fanatic) with a walking speed of 15 feet, [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet, resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against poison) and her apprentice, [Raegrin Mau](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744330-raegrin-mau) (a neutral evil, male wood elf [cultist](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16835-cultist) with [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet, advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed), and immunity to magic that would put him to sleep), are both in a state of deep meditation, praying to Tiamat for a cure for the dwarf’s affliction. Even if combat broke out in area C5, they remain unaware of the characters’ presence until they are disturbed or attacked. Hulil and Raegrin are both greedy servants of Tiamat and the Uttolot family. Raegrin follows Hulil’s every order with unshaking loyalty.

Hulil is so desperate for a cure for the ailment that is slowly killing her that she doesn’t attack the characters when she first sees them, as long as she isn’t attacked first. Instead, she orders them to stand down and demands to know why they came to the cave. A quick-thinking character can claim to have come to help Hulil (at the direction of her sister, after receiving a message from Tiamat, or with another appropriate rationale). With a successful Charisma ([Deception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception)) check opposed by Hulil’s Wisdom ([Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight)) check, the character convinces the dwarf that all the characters are her allies. On a failed check, or if the characters challenge her, Hulil and Raegrin attack.

Any creature that enters the area of the fire for the first time on its turn, or that starts its turn there, takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.

If the characters convince [Hulil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744316-hulil-lutan) that they are her allies, or if they capture her or Raegrin and succeed on a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Intimidation)) check, they can learn the following information:

- Hulil believes she has a disease called frigid woe. Though she doesn’t know any more about the disease than its symptoms, she’s heard rumors that explorers in Eiselcross sometimes succumb to it.
- Hulil has guessed that her affliction was caused by one of the blue vials Tulgi stole from Pelc’s Curiosities, originally sold by Urgon Wenth. The vial was cracked, revealing that its lovely color was the result of a dark blue dust clinging to the interior.
- She is desperate to get to Shadycreek Run before the malady runs its course, hoping that she can trade the goods stolen by Tulgi for a cure.

Hulil used one of the vials to trap the chest containing the other stolen items (see “Stone Chest” below). Needing quick cash for the trip, she sold the other vial to Irven Liel, a human merchant staying at the Jolly Dwarf inn in Palebank Village while traveling with his family to Uthodurn.

The stone chest’s outer lid is carved with the face of a dragon. A character who examines the chest and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check finds pin-sized openings in the dragon’s mouth that contain a blue powder. The powder can be removed with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. A character who fails this check must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract frigid woe (see the “[Eiselcross](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer-eiselcross)” section of chapter 3 of [Explorer's Guide to Wildemount](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw)).

A [detect magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic) spell reveals that the chest radiates an aura of evocation magic. When a creature touches the chest without speaking a prayer to Tiamat, a gust of wind escapes the dragon’s mouth. If the blue powder is still in the dragon’s mouth, it forms a cloud that fills a 15-foot cube in front of the chest. Each creature within the area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract frigid woe.

The chest contains the rest of the treasure found by Urgon Wenth—a gilded scroll case covered in a cosmological map of the multiverse (worth 15 gp), a jade statuette of a storm giant (25 gp), a quiver containing six [+1 arrows](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4839-arrows-1), and a silver ring set with a jasper stone (50 gp). It also holds Hulil’s wealth—415 cp, 234 sp, 43 ep, and 112 gp—and a receipt indicating that Hulil sold a blue glass vial to Irven Liel for 100 gp.

When the characters are done exploring Croaker Cave, they should know the blue glass vials found by Urgon Wenth are the source of the strange malady that is turning people into ice statues, and that Irven Liel has one of those vials. If the characters don’t have a chance to question [Hulil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744316-hulil-lutan) or [Raegrin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744330-raegrin-mau), you can have the chest also contain a journal or notes that provide the information they need and point them toward the Jolly Dwarf inn.
