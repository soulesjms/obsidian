> The slow dripping of water from the ceiling flows to a pool in the southwest corner of this cavern. A large wooden bucket with a lid sits near the edge of the pool.

Three Uttolot [bandits](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16798-bandit) and two [giant ice frogs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16884-giant-frog) normally occupy this cavern. If the bandits have not yet been alerted to disturbances, they are training the frogs. Add the following:

> A dwarf and two elves bundled in layers of winter clothing are throwing dead bats into the air. Two giant blue-skinned frogs leap up to snatch the bats in midair, seemingly as part of some sort of training session.

```encounter
name: Encounter
players: []
creatures:
  - "2": Giant Frog
```

If the bandits went to investigate disturbances in adjacent areas, the frogs are hiding in the pool.

The bucket holds six dead bats used as training treats. A character who offers a dead bat to a frog has advantage on their next Wisdom ([Animal Handling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AnimalHandling)) check made to control that frog’s behavior.
