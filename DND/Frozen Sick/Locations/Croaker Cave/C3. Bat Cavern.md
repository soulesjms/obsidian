> This cavern reeks, and its floor is covered in bat guano.

A [swarm of bats](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17028-swarm-of-bats) sleeps among the stalactites in this cavern. If anything disturbs the bats (including a light source or a loud noise in the cavern), the swarm attacks the source of the disturbance. The swarm fights until reduced to half its hit points or fewer, then flees out of the cave complex. If combat breaks out in this area, the bandits in area C2 come to investigate.
