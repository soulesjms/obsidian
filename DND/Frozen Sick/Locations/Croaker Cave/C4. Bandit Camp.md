> Ten empty bedrolls are arranged in a circle around a cold fire pit at the center of this cavern. Chicken bones, empty wine and spirits bottles, and other food waste litters the floor.

One of the bedrolls covers the opening of a 10-foot-deep pit trap. The trap can be spotted with a DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check. If not spotted, anyone walking across the bedroll falls into the pit, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and landing [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone). A creature that falls into the pit makes enough noise that the bandits in [area C2](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#C2TrainingPool) investigate.

Searching all the bedrolls reveals that one contains an unopened bottle of Bald Dwarf Whisky (worth 25 gp), an alcohol made by elves in Uthodurn.
