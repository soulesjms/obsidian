Characters local to Palebank Village or who have spent some time there know Croaker Cave. If all the characters are new arrivals to the village, any of the villagers can tell them about the cave and how to get there.

Croaker Cave gets its name from its resident giant ice frogs. Its entrance is on the shores of the Frigid Depths, due north of Palebank Village. As the characters draw close to the cave entrance, they see frequent signs of tracks where bandits have been coming and going. However, there are no signs of patrols or guards. A plume of smoke rises from the ground beyond the cave entrance, venting through a narrow natural chimney from [area C6](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#C6HulilsCavern). The chimney is too small to be climbed, however, and the main cave entrance is the only entry point.

Knowing that the residents of Palebank Village avoid the cave and its dangerous frogs, [Hulil Lutan](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744316-hulil-lutan) has made the place her base of operations. She and the Uttolot bandits she commands have domesticated the giant ice frogs that make the cave their home, using them as guard animals.

With the exception of [Old Croaker](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744327-old-croaker) (see [area C5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#C5OldCroakersPool)), giant ice frogs are [giant frogs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16884-giant-frog) with immunity to cold damage.

The blue-skinned frogs attack any creatures in the cave complex not escorted by bandits they recognize. Each fights until reduced to half its hit points or fewer, then flees. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AnimalHandling)) check as an action convinces one frog to not attack or to stop attacking. If the character or any of their allies attacks or harms the frog, it resumes combat.

The frogs spend much of their time resting in pools of murky, frigid water in Croaker Cave. A character who succeeds on a Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check opposed by a frog’s Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth)) check notices a frog hiding in a pool. If a frog goes undetected, it attacks with [surprise](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Surprise) when a character comes within 5 feet of the pool.

The bandits sent out with Hulil by the Uttolot family are all dwarves and elves. Up to ten bandits normally occupy Croaker Cave, but only three are currently present (in [area C2](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#C2TrainingPool)). They use the [bandit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16798-bandit) stat block and have [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. In addition, the dwarves have resistance to poison damage and have advantage on saving throws against poison; the elves have advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed) and immunity to magic that would put them to sleep

Uttolot bandits attack any intruders on sight. Each fights until reduced to half its hit points or fewer, then flees the caves. If the characters capture an Uttolot bandit, they can learn the following information with a successful DC 10 Charisma ([Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Intimidation)) check:

- Hulil is sick with the same malady that killed Urgon Wenth.
- She plans on setting out for Shadycreek Run soon, hoping that trading the items her sister Tulgi stole from Pelc’s Curiosities allows her to pay for healing that will cure her.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#Ceilings)Ceilings

Cavern ceilings are 10 feet high, with only 8 feet of clearance beneath stalactites.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#Walls)Walls

Climbing the rough walls of a cavern requires a successful DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics)) check.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#Light)Light

The caverns contain no light sources, except in [area C6](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#C6HulilsCavern), as the inhabitants of Croaker Cave rely on [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) to see.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#FrigidPools)Frigid Pools

Pools of murky, frigid water within the caverns are created by melting snow on the rocky ground above dripping down through the ceiling. Each pool is 10 feet deep. A creature completely submerged in a pool must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion). Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on this saving throw. For each minute the creature spends submerged in a pool, it must repeat this saving throw, gaining another level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion) on a failure.
