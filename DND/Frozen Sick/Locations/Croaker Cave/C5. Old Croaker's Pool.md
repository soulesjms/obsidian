> Water dripping down from stalactites in the ceiling fills a dark pool that completely covers the floor of this cavern.

Croaker Cave’s largest denizen—named Old Croaker by the Uttolot bandits—has claimed this pool. It hides in the water and attacks as other giant ice frogs. Old Croaker is a [giant toad](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16896-giant-toad) with immunity to cold damage.

[Old Croaker](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744327-old-croaker) has been trained to ferry Hulil and visitors to her cavern (area C6) across the pool. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AnimalHandling)) check to convince Old Croaker to not attack the party can also convince the frog to ferry all the characters across the pool one at a time.
