The Jolly Dwarf is a cozy, two-story inn run by a retired adventurer named Arl Bortock. When the characters enter the inn, read:

> [!DM READ]
> The downstairs of this inn features a large taproom. A gray-haired dwarf behind the bar greets you cheerfully as you enter. Two male humans and two tiefling children laugh among themselves as they enjoy a meal together.

Arl Bortock (a neutral good, male, mountain dwarf [veteran](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17045-veteran)) works behind the bar. If the characters ask for Irven Liel, the dwarf points them toward the laughing family.

Irven Liel, his husband Fenton Tethwick (both neutral good, male Dwendalian human [commoners](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16829-commoner)), and their adopted daughters Honor and Magic (both tiefling noncombatants) are friendly and invite the characters to join them. Irven and Fenton are traveling booksellers. If asked about the vial, Irven explains that they met [Hulil Lutan](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744316-hulil-lutan) on the road to Palebank Village. She said she was moving and needed to shed some possessions, so she offered him a chance to buy the Aeorian relic at a great price. He plans to sell the item for a profit in Uthodurn.

If the characters tell Irven the truth about the vial, he panics, saying that everyone in his family has touched the object. Fenton gives the vial to the characters, handing it to them wrapped up in a cloth. Any character who touches the vial directly must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract frigid woe.

Once the characters have the cracked vial, they can report back to Elro Aldataur. He pays them 100 gp as promised but asks the characters to stay in town. He is quite certain he’ll have need of their services again soon.

The next morning, Elro comes to the characters with somber news. Irven, Fenton, Honor, and Magic are all afflicted with frigid woe. Seeing the blue powder in the vial has allowed Elro to consult old lore and learn a few things about the disease. (If the characters didn’t learn the name of the affliction from Hulil, Elro is the source of that name as well.)

Elro knows that frigid woe is said to have only one cure—a milky liquid the Aeorians stored in gold vials. He hopes that the cure might be found in the same place Urgon found the vials of frigid woe in Eiselcross. The retired ranger asks the characters to travel to the islands of Eiselcross and retrace Urgon’s path, hoping they can find the cure. He offers the party 200 gp for the task, and reminds them that time is of the essence for Irven and his family—not to mention for any characters infected with frigid woe. If the characters accept, Elro gives them a day to prepare and tells them to find him at the village docks when they’re ready to set sail.

> VIALS OF FRIGID WOE
> As an action, a creature can throw a vial of frigid woe up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact and releasing its contents as a cloud of spores. Each creature within 5 feet of the vial when it shatters must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract [frigid woe](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer-eiselcross#FrigidWoe) (see the “[Eiselcross](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer-eiselcross)” section of chapter 3 of [Explorer's Guide to Wildemount](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw)).
> 
> If a character has contracted frigid woe, track the number of days that have passed so you can inform the player when their character’s symptoms appear and when they need to make Constitution saving throws.
