When the characters approach Tulgi’s cabin, read:

> [!DM Read]
> This snow-covered cabin looks peaceful and quiet from the outside. Its windows are shuttered, and a steady stream of smoke piping out of the chimney indicates a roaring fire within.

Tulgi Lutan’s home is a one-story, one-room log cabin. Because she isn’t keen on letting the characters in, the following features might be important:

- The roof of the cabin is 12 feet high. Climbing up the outside walls requires a successful DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics)) check.
- The wooden door to the cabin is locked and has AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The lock can be picked with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, or the door can be forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics)) check. Tulgi carries the key that unlocks the door.
- Each of the cabin’s four walls has one window, which is shuttered and latched from the inside. A window can be unlatched from outside with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.
- The inside of the cabin is brightly lit by fires in a brazier and a fireplace, though the smoky haze given off by both makes the interior [lightly obscured](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#VisionandLight).

If the characters knock on the door, Tulgi Lutan (a neutral evil, female mountain dwarf [thug](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17035-thug) with a walking speed of 10 feet) calls from the other side, telling them to go away. A character who shouts back through the door and succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma ([Deception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception), [Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Intimidation), or [Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion)) check convinces Tulgi to open the door and allow the party inside. Otherwise, she ignores anything the characters say.

If the characters aren’t invited inside, they’ll have to decide what other means they’re willing to use to enter. Regardless of how they do so, when the characters enter the cabin, read:

> [!DM Read]
> The heat in this small cabin hits like a hammer blow. A table set with neatly stacked dishes, tools, and utensils stands at the center of the room. The smell of a simmering soup comes from a pot hanging inside a roaring fireplace. Another fire burns in an iron brazier at the opposite end of the room, filling the cabin with a smoky haze. Shivering at the end of a bed near the brazier is a dwarf wrapped in blankets. Bulging blue veins streak her face, neck, and hands.

If the characters broke into the cabin, Tulgi attacks as soon as she sees them, fighting until reduced to 10 hit points, then surrendering. She has two pet [wolves](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17062-wolf), Iro and Jira, that hide beneath her bed. If a fight breaks out, the wolves join the fray to defend her.

Any creature that comes into contact with the brazier or the fireplace for the first time on its turn, or that starts its turn there, takes 2 (1d4) fire damage.

Tulgi is gruff and to the point, and tries to compensate for her illness with bluster. If the characters entered the cabin with her permission or if she surrenders to them, she tells them only that she has the same affliction that killed Urgon, and that she’s looking for a cure.

A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma ([Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion)) check convinces Tulgi to reveal the following information:

- Tulgi came to Palebank Village a few years back from Shadycreek Run with her sister, [Hulil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744316-hulil-lutan). Both work for the Uttolot family.
- The Uttolots sent the sisters and a few others to the village to keep an eye on treasures coming back from Eiselcross—with the intent of stealing them. When such artifacts come through the small settlement, they are often unusual goods that treasure hunters are trying to keep away from Uthodurn or the Dwendalian Empire.
- When Urgon Wenth returned to Palebank Village with treasures from Eiselcross, Tulgi saw her chance. She waited for Urgon to sell his finds to Pelc’s Curiosities, then stole them all.
- Tulgi gave most of Urgon’s relics to Hulil, but kept one for herself—an ornate dagger. She grudgingly gives this weapon to the characters if asked (see “Treasure” below). Hulil has the other items in a site north of the village known as Croaker Cave.
- Tulgi was the one who searched Urgon’s cabin, convinced that the dead dwarf must have had magic or other secrets stored away there.

If Tulgi doesn’t offer her dagger to the characters, any character with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) score of 11 or higher notices the ornate blade in a gilded sheath tucked under her shirt. If the characters claim the [+1 dagger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5225-dagger-1), a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana) or [History](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History)) check reveals that the dagger is a relic of the fallen flying city of Aeor.

The characters have no trouble finding either Croaker Cave or Pelc’s Curiosities if either of those locations is their next destination. If things went bad with Tulgi and she died before revealing any information, the characters might find notes or instructions from Hulil revealing some of the information above.
