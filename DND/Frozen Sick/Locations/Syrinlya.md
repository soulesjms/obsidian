As Morgo leads the characters through Syrinlya, read:

Morgo gestures to the groups of dwarves and elves huddled and chatting around campfires. “They’re planning expeditions to find Aeor’s lost treasures,” she says. “That’s what this whole place is about. If you ain’t exploring, you ain’t banking gold.”

The dwarf stops in front of a large fur-lined yurt. “You can stay here. Belonged to a fool rich elf named Bertron who came here looking for adventure. He found the inside of a saber-toothed tiger instead. Should be some food and the like in there. It’s yours now.”

### Bertron’s Yurt

The characters are welcome to this yurt during their time in Syrinlya. When they first enter, read:

The sound of wind and the biting cold die down as you enter the yurt. A cold fire pit marks the center of the hide-covered floor. An open crate containing packaged rations and a few other items stands next to the door.

Once the characters are settled, Morgo wishes them luck and leaves to prepare for an expedition of her own (see the “Can You Help Us?” sidebar). The crate contains 50 days of rations, a [50-foot silk rope](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/rope-silk-50-feet), a [blanket](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/blanket), a [grappling hook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/grappling-hook), a miner’s pick, and a book titled _Adventure Sexy: Impress Potential Lovers with Great Deeds_ by Scanlan Shorthalt.

CAN YOU HELP US?

If the characters feel as though they need help traveling the wilds of Foren, they can try to convince other explorers in Syrinlya to travel with them to recover the cure. Although most of Syrinlya’s explorers are willing to help others in need, those explorers already have an important mission. An expedition led by Professor Gulrim Shalebrow (see “[The Diarchy of Uthodurn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/factions-and-societies#DiarchyofUthodurn)” in chapter 2 of [Explorer's Guide to Wildemount](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw)) went to search for the origin of the strange magic in the region of Mutalos months ago and has not returned. The explorers at the camp are preparing a search and rescue mission to bring back Gulrim’s party. If the characters survive their quest into Salsvault, this story could serve as a hook for another adventure.

Morgo Delwur or any other resident of Syrinlya can point out the Buyer’s hut to the characters. It is Syrinlya’s largest yurt. When the characters enter, read:

The pungent scent of incense fills this yurt, whose walls are painted with glowing arcane runes. A brass brazier burns brightly at the center of the floor, around which are set a few plush chairs, a bed, and a large stone chest. On one of those chairs sits an elf reading a book. A small dragon with green butterfly wings is curled in the elf’s lap.

The Buyer (lawful neutral, nonbinary, high elf [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16947-mage)) is a mysterious elf who purchases Aeorian relics in Syrinlya for the Uthodurnian government. See the “[Syrinlya](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer-eiselcross#Syrinlya)” section of chapter 3 of [Explorer's Guide to Wildemount](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw) for more information about the Buyer and their business. The [green faerie dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17108-faerie-dragon-older) is Dew, the elf’s familiar.

The Buyer has been in Syrinlya since the day the outpost was founded. They can answer any questions the characters might have about the outpost’s history, the island of Foren, or frigid woe. If the characters want to confirm that the Buyer is able to quickly send the cure for frigid woe to Palebank Village, the elf tells them that the stone chest in the yurt has the magical capability to teleport objects on command.

In addition to the aid they provide in getting the cure back to Palebank Village, the Buyer offers to purchase any Aeorian relics the characters want to sell.

A [detect magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic) spell reveals that the chest radiates an aura of conjuration magic. When an item is placed in the chest, the Buyer can teleport it to secret locations in Uthodurn or its outpost of Palebank Village, with those locations known only to the authorities of those settlements.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#OrvoMustave)Orvo Mustave

Morgo Delwur or any other resident of Syrinlya can point out Orvo Mustave’s tent to the characters. When the characters approach the tent, read:

A campfire burns in front of this small tent, whose flaps are open. Inside the tent sits a young dwarf whose face is scarred as though scratched by a large claw. A shortsword is casually laid across his lap as he warms his outstretched hands.

Orvo Mustave (a chaotic good, male mountain dwarf [scout](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17007-scout)) is a curious and soft-spoken explorer. He enjoys uncovering the secrets of Eiselcross as much as he does uncovering the region’s treasures. He is genuinely interested in the characters’ lives, and asks them lots of questions after inviting them to share his fire.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#OrvosStory)Orvo’s Story

Orvo is grief-stricken to hear about the demise of his friend Urgon Wenth. If the characters ask Orvo about the blue vials that brought disease to Palebank Village, Orvo shares the following information:

- Orvo and Urgon found the blue vials in Salsvault, an Aeorian ruin partially submerged in water in a region of Foren where the glacial ice is thin. Explorers call this region Thin Sheets. Orvo believes the ruin is as well preserved as it is because the structure was reinforced with magic, as were many of Aeor’s buildings that housed hazardous materials or secret projects.
- Salsvault is two hundred miles northwest of Syrinlya. Ice mephits are drawn to the magic of something at that location. Orvo and Urgon found the ruin after following one of the creatures.
- Salsvault appears to have been an Aeorian lab. Orvo and Urgon explored only three of its chambers before being chased away by animated suits of armor.
- The dwarves didn’t know what the vials contained.
- Orvo sold his share of the treasure from Salsvault to the Buyer. Urgon decided to hang onto his share until he returned home to Palebank Village.
