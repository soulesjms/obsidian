When the characters are ready to leave for Eiselcross, Elro Aldataur provides them with the following information:

- Elro has arranged passage to Eiselcross for the characters on the _Remorhaz_, a sailing ship owned and operated by the Glassblades.
- The characters will be taken to Syrinlya, an Uthodurnian outpost on Foren, Eiselcross’s largest island. Once there, they should talk to a dwarf named Orvo Mustave, who has gone on numerous expeditions into the wilds of Eiselcross with Urgon Wenth.
- Once the characters have found the cure, they should use whatever they need for themselves, then give the rest to an elf in Syrinlya who goes by the name “the Buyer.” They can tell the Buyer to teleport the cure to Elro in Palebank Village.

The islands of Eiselcross are covered in ice and snow, and are always well below freezing. Characters who don’t already have cold weather gear will want to purchase it, or they will be subject to [extreme cold](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#ExtremeCold) (see [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#Weather) of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg)).

SAILING TO EISELCROSS

The characters are in a race against time to cure Irven and his family (and possibly Hulil and Tulgi Lutan, if the characters are feeling merciful toward those two hardened criminals). Irven and his family have at least sixty days before any of them might die, Hulil has at least thirty days, and Tulgi has at least twenty days. You can make saving throws for these NPCs against the disease every ten days, or you can just decide their final fates.

It takes the _Remorhaz_ nine days to get to Syrinlya. This trip could be uneventful, or you could populate the ship with interesting NPCs and have the characters encounter ocean monsters, Revelry pirates, or severe weather.

When the ship reaches Syrinlya, read:

> [!DM READ]
> The temperature has steadily dropped since you left Palebank Village, yet it seems to grow colder still as you step off the ramp of the _Remorhaz_ onto Foren. Through windy snow, you can see fur-lined tents and yurts arranged in a large camp. Campfires are whipped by the wind, with dwarves and elves huddled close to the flames.
> 
> “Don’t worry! It’ll cool down here eventually!” a joking voice bellows over the snow. A female dwarf with a shaggy mane of unkempt hair bows to you. “Morgo Delwur at your service. Welcome to Eiselcross!”

Morgo Delwur (a neutral good, female mountain dwarf [werebear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17053-werebear)) has lived in Syrinlya for years. She can show the characters around and answer any questions they have about the settlement, providing any of the details found in [chapter 3](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer-eiselcross#Syrinlya) of [Explorer's Guide to Wildemount](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw). If the characters ask about Orvo Mustave or the Buyer, Morgo points out where both live. Though Morgo never adventured with Urgon Wenth and wasn’t a close friend, she is sad to hear of the dwarf’s passing.

Morgo and the other explorers in Syrinlya know about frigid woe and the disease’s terrible effects. If the characters have any unanswered questions about the disease, the explorers share what they know.
