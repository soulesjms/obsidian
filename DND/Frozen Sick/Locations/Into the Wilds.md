After speaking with Orvo, the characters can make whatever preparations they need before heading into the wilds of Eiselcross. If they wish to obtain more supplies before setting out, there are no shops in Syrinlya, but many of the explorers at the camp are willing to trade goods and equipment.

The characters must travel two hundred miles over ice and snow to reach Salsvault, the ruin where Urgon Wenth found the vials of frigid woe. It’s up to the characters whether they want to move at a fast, medium, or slow pace (see “[Movement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring#Movement)” in chapter 8 of the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb)). If any character has a walking speed of less than 25 feet because of a frigid woe infection, use the Reduced Travel Speeds table to determine how far the party can travel in a day.

|Slowest Character Speed|Slow Pace|Medium Pace|Fast Pace|
|---|---|---|---|
|15–20 ft.|12 miles|18 miles|24 miles|
|5–10 ft.|6 miles|12 miles|18 miles|

As the characters travel, use the Encounters in Eiselcross section to generate random encounters.

|d6|Encounter|
|---|---|
|1|The characters encounter 1d4 wildfolk [scouts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17007-scout) hunting a [saber-toothed tiger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17002-saber-toothed-tiger). The scouts are out of arrows and willing to trade equipment and information to replenish their ammunition.|
|2|The characters encounter a lost Cerberus Assembly [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16947-mage) trying to return to Balenpost. The rest of the mage's team died in the ruins of Aeor, and there is a 50 percent chance the mage carries a recently recovered Aeorian item.|
|3|The characters find a [griffon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16913-griffon) with an arrow in its wing that prevents it from flying. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AnimalHandling)) check can approach the griffon without being attacked. Such a character can remove the arrow, restoring the griffon's ability to fly, after which the griffon allows the character to ride it as a mount for the next 1d10 days.|
|4|The characters encounter the [revenant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17196-revenant) of a dead explorer from Balenpost who was murdered by one of its team and is looking for vengeance.|
|5|The characters find a 3-foot-tall, 50-pound egg. If they keep the egg in a cold environment for 1d10 weeks, a [white dragon wyrmling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17058-white-dragon-wyrmling) hatches from it.|
|6|A [young remorhaz](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17195-young-remorhaz) ambushes the characters.|

After traveling forty miles, the characters enter Thin Sheets. This region is known for its large patches of thin ice over deep, frigid water (see the rules for [frigid water](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#FrigidWater) and [thin ice](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#ThinIce) in [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#WildernessHazards) of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg)).

When the characters have traveled two hundred miles, one character who acts as a scout for the group should make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival)) check each day. On a failure, the character finds no signs of Salsvault. On a success, the character finds the trail of an ice mephit, which leads to Salsvault after a journey of 1d4 hours. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character finds Salsvault directly.
