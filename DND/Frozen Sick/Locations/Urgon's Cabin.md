Urgon Wenth lived in a one-story, one-room log cabin at the edge of town. A good-natured Glassblade rookie named Mila Teno (a lawful good, female wood elf [scout](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17007-scout)) stands guard outside the front door. If the characters explain why they’ve come, she allows them to enter the house and look around. When the characters enter the cabin, read:

> [!NOTE]
> This cramped, dark cabin might have been a cozy place when its owner was alive. Now an unmade bed stands near a cold fireplace, its mantle hung with the head of some snarling white beast with gray horns. On the other side of the room, a small table strewn with dirty dishes and set with a dwarf-sized chair stands before two empty shelves whose contents are scattered across the floor: kitchen utensils, dried foodstuffs, adventuring gear, and a few books.

Any character who examines the mess in the cabin realizes that someone recently trashed the place while searching it. A successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation)) check reveals the intruder’s footprints. Tulgi Lutan was the culprit, desperate for any clues that might help her cure the frigid woe that is killing her. Her tracks lead outside and back to her cabin (see [[Tulgi's Cabin]]).

Urgon’s adventuring equipment consists of a silvered maul; a suit of splint armor sized for a dwarf; bulky, fur-lined clothing sized for a dwarf; a grappling hook; and a hooded lantern.

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature)) check recognizes that the head mounted above the mantle belonged to a yeti, a monstrosity found in Eiselcross.

A character who searches through the books on the shelf and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation)) check finds a folded receipt used as a bookmark. The receipt is dated two months previous, and indicates that Urgon sold several Aeorian items found in Eiselcross to local antique shop Pelc’s Curiosities for 1,000 gp. The items are listed as a dagger, a scroll case, a jade statuette, a quiver of twenty arrows, a silver ring set with a jasper, and two blue glass vials.

Characters who are residents of Palebank Village or have been there for a while know of Pelc’s Curiosities—and also know that the shop was robbed and vandalized two months ago.

After searching the cabin, the characters can continue their investigation by going to Tulgi’s cabin or by stopping at Pelc’s Curiosities (assuming they found the receipt).
