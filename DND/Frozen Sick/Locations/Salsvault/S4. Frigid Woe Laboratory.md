> [!NOTE]
> Smashed stone tables litter the floor in this chamber. Two stone chests built into the floor stand next to each other along the far wall. A door to the west is inscribed with words in Draconic runes. A large iron lever is flipped into the up position on the wall next to the door.

The inscription in archaic Draconic reads: “Disease storage. Authorized personnel only.”

These stone chests are locked (see “[Salsvault Features](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#SalsvaultFeatures)” at the beginning of this section) and magically trapped. When a creature makes a failed attempt to pick the chest’s lock, or attacks or attempts to force the chest open, the chest shoots a beam of cold energy at the creature. The beam is +4 to hit and deals 4 (1d8) cold damage on a hit.

A character who searches the exterior of either chest and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check finds an archaic Draconic word for “ice” carved in tiny letters near the hinges. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana)) check, a character senses that the inscription is connected to a trap. Scratching out the inscription with a tool or a weapon causes the trap to stop functioning on that chest.

Each chest is packed with fine sand, within which are nestled two vials of frigid woe (see the “[Vials of Frigid Woe](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#VialsofFrigidWoe)” sidebar earlier in this adventure).

A character who examines the lever notices spots of faded red paint on it with a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check. As an action, a creature can pull the lever down, causing flames to shoot down from the ceiling in [area S5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#S5DiseaseStorage). Even with the door closed, a hiss can be heard in this area when the flames are active. A creature can use an action to push the lever back up, which shuts off the flames. See area S5 for more information on this hazard.

The doors from this area to [areas S1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#S1EntranceChamber) and S5 are locked. The door to area S5 is also trapped.

A [detect magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic) spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic radiating from the locked door to area S5. When a creature makes a failed attempt to pick the door’s lock, or attacks or attempts to force the door open, that creature is teleported into the middle of [area S15](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#S15AnimatedWeaponStorage).

A character who searches the door and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation)) check finds an archaic Draconic word for “disappear” carved in tiny letters near the foot of the door on both sides. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana)) check, a character senses that the inscription is connected to a trap. Scratching out either inscription with a tool or a weapon causes the trap to stop functioning.
