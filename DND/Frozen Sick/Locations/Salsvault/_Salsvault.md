Salsvault was once a laboratory in the city of Aeor, where mages who specialized in necromancy and transmutation magic crafted constructs and diseases to be weaponized against their enemies. Many of the laboratory’s creations remain active, still guarding the diseases and treasures within.

As the characters approach Salsvault, read:

> [!NOTE]
> Through wind-whipped snow and biting cold, you notice a half-submerged, dark-blue stone building poking up through the ice. A gray stone door is carved to look like a face with a half-exposed skull. Scribed above the door is the word “SALSVAULT.”

Ziro and Glacies, two [ice mephits](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16932-ice-mephit), hide near the entrance to Salsvault, waiting for someone to open the door. A character with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) score of 13 or higher notices the mephits. If any characters interact with the mephits, they attack in response. If the characters don’t notice the mephits, the creatures follow them inside Salsvault, attracted to the frigid woe within. The first time the characters enter an area containing vials of frigid woe, the mephits seek out and break the vials, reveling in releasing the cold-based magical energy within.

The entrance to Salsvault is frozen shut. The characters can force the door open with a successful DC 15 Strength check or by dealing 10 bludgeoning or fire damage to the ice that seals the door. Unsealing the door with bludgeoning damage draws the attention of two suits of animated armor in area [S3](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#S3AnimatedArmorLaboratory), which gather in [area S1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#S1EntranceChamber) and attack the characters as soon as they enter.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#SalsvaultFeatures)Salsvault Features

The locations in Salsvault are detailed on map 5.10. Unless otherwise noted in an area’s description, the following features are common throughout all areas of Salsvault.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#Ceilings2)Ceilings

The ceilings in Salsvault’s rooms are 10 feet high, with 8-foot-high doorways connecting them.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#Chests)Chests

Stone chests two feet on each side are built into the floors in several areas. A [detect magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic) spell reveals a faint aura of abjuration magic radiating from each chest. A chest has AC 17; 27 hit points; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

If an area’s description notes a locked chest, the chest’s lock can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools or forced open with a successful DC 18 Strength check. [Ferol Sal](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744310-ferol-sal) (see [area S17](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#S17FerolsLaboratory)) carries a master key that locks or unlocks all chests in Salsvault.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#DoorsAndWalls)Doors and Walls

Salsvault’s heavy doors are made of black stone, and its walls are made of blue stone. A [detect magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic) spell reveals a faint aura of abjuration magic radiating from the doors and walls. Each door and each 10-foot section of wall has AC 17; 27 hit points; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

If an area’s description notes a locked door, the lock can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, or the door can be forced open with a successful DC 18 Strength check. [Ferol Sal](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744310-ferol-sal) (see [area S17](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#S17FerolsLaboratory)) carries a master key that locks or unlocks all the doors in Salsvault.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#AeorianRobes)Aeorian Robes

The undead in the complex wear archaic-looking robes. With a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([History](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History)) check, a character recognizes the robes as being of Aeorian style. The characters can also find intact robes of the same style in the complex. Constructs and zombies in the complex don’t attack a character wearing intact robes, unless the character attacks first.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#EasternSlope)Eastern Slope

Salsvault is tilted in the ice, with its east side lower than its west side. Every area within the complex features a gentle slope downward to the east.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#Light2)Light

Unless otherwise noted, wall sconces with [continual flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/continual-flame) spells cast on them brightly light the interior of Salsvault.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#Temperature)Temperature

Though Salsvault’s interior is guarded from wind and snow, the temperatures within the structure are still well below freezing.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#Water)Water

Some areas of Salsvault are partially filled with seawater flowing in from beneath the ice of Thin Sheets. A creature that starts its turn in the frigid water must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion). Creatures that lair within the water in the complex are immune to this effect.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#DenizensofSalsvault)Denizens of Salsvault

Many of the creatures the characters can encounter in Salsvault have similar characteristics and tactics.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#Beasts)Beasts

Several sea creatures haunt the submerged areas of the complex. These beasts attack characters who enter the water, fighting until reduced to half their hit points or fewer before fleeing.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#Constructs)Constructs

When Salsvault crashed into Foren, a number of its construct guardians survived. Those constructs continue to guard the complex, fighting intruders until they flee Salsvault. The constructs won’t leave the complex willingly and won’t pursue characters who do so. The constructs don’t attack the undead of Salsvault, understanding on some level that those undead are the remains of the people who created them.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#Undead)Undead

The humanoids working in Salsvault died when it crashed into Foren. Just before impact, [Ferol Sal](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744310-ferol-sal), the necromancer in charge of Salsvault, released an experimental disease that caused any humanoids who died in the complex to return as undead. Most of those affected returned as zombies that attack intruders on sight and fight to the death. Ferol returned as a wight and has continued to work obsessively in his personal lab ([area S17](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#S17FerolsLaboratory)) ever since. Because of the cold here, all the undead are relatively well preserved.
