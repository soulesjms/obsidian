As the characters approach this room, read:

> [!NOTE]
> A large red X is painted across the stone door before you. Violent banging and the sound of heavy objects being tossed around emanates from the chamber beyond.

The door is locked. If the characters open it, read:

> [!NOTE]
> As you open the door to this debris-filled room, a humanoid creature made of pieces of stitched-together flesh charges toward you. The monster’s body is covered in wounds, and broken pieces of bone stick through its skin at odd angles.

When Salsvault crashed into Foren, this golem servant of the mages was driven mad from the damage it took. Ferol locked the golem in this room ages ago. The [golem](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744309-damaged-flesh-golem) uses the [flesh golem](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16863-flesh-golem) stat block, with these changes:

- The golem has 5 hit points remaining, and its Berserk trait is activated.
- The golem has the use of only one arm and can’t use its Multiattack. Its challenge rating is 1 (200 XP).

The golem has long since smashed all the objects in this chamber not destroyed by Salsvault’s crash. Any search of the debris turns up only bits of bone, clay, iron, stone, and paper.
