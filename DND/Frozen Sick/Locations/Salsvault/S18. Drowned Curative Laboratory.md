> [!NOTE]
> A cold wind howls through the collapsed east wall of this huge chamber, whose far side is completely submerged under frigid seawater. A dense bed of kelp grows up from the submerged floor, obscuring any sight of what lies below. Broken glass and the remains of shattered tables cover the floor in the dry section of the room.

Aeorian mages worked in this chamber to ensure that they could cure the diseases they created. Four [giant crabs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16879-giant-crab) now lair here, hiding beneath the kelp in the 5-foot-deep water and attacking any creatures that intrude. A character with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) score of 14 or higher notices the crabs, which attack with [surprise](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Surprise) if not spotted. See “[Salsvault Features](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#SalsvaultFeatures),” at the beginning of this section, for what happens if characters enter the frigid water. Additionally, the kelp makes the water [difficult terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#DifficultTerrain) for creatures other than the giant crabs.

A character with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) score of 11 or higher notices a stone chest built into the floor and submerged in the water against the back wall. The chest is locked (see “[Salsvault Features](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#SalsvaultFeatures)” at the beginning of this section).

The chest is packed with fine sand and contains twenty doses of frigid woe antidote (see “[Eiselcross](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer-eiselcross#Eiselcross)” in chapter 3 of [Explorer's Guide to Wildemount](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw)) and an [ersatz eye](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/27048-ersatz-eye) (see [chapter 6](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-treasures#ErsatzEye) of [Explorer's Guide to Wildemount](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw)).
