### 

The door to Ferol Sal’s personal quarters is locked. When the characters can see this area, read:

> [!NOTE]
> This room is in immaculate condition, apparently having been cleaned up after the destruction seen elsewhere in the complex. A crisply made bed stands at the center of the west wall, with small tables off to either side. The room also contains a stone desk set with a chair, and a chest built into the floor.

Though the undead Ferol no longer sleeps here, he and the zombies tidied up his personal space after Salsvault crashed into Eiselcross.

The chest contains Ferol’s treasure (see below), along with a [swarm of undead snakes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744338-swarm-of-undead-snakes) that attacks any creature that opens the chest. The swarm uses the stat block for a [swarm of poisonous snakes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17030-swarm-of-poisonous-snakes), with these changes:

- The swarm is made of Tiny undead that don’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- The swarm has immunity to poison damage and the [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned) condition.

Any search of the desk turns up a bottle of dried ink, several used quills, five sheets of blank parchment, and a piece of paper with a faded message written on it in archaic Draconic. A character who understands Draconic can spend a few minutes to piece together the meaning of the note, or it can be deciphered with a [comprehend languages](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/comprehend-languages) spell or similar magic. The note reads:

> [!NOTE]
> To whomever finds this:
> 
> All my people are dead: my family, my friends, and my workers. I, too, am dead. Were it not for my quick thinking and prowess with necromancy, our important work at Salsvault would be over. I continue to labor in my undead form, trying to find a sickness that can infect the gods themselves. If I have perished, I implore you to find my lab, find my notes, and finish my work. The gods must pay for Aeor’s destruction.

> —Ferol Sal
