Salsvault’s crash into Foren destroyed the magic torches in this room, leaving it shrouded in darkness. When the characters can see into this area, read:

> [!NOTE]
> Debris from broken stone furniture covers the floor. The walls here are cracked, as if they once supported built-in shelves that have been reduced to rubble.

The floor of this chamber is covered in rubble, making it [difficult terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#DifficultTerrain). A [rug of smothering](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17000-rug-of-smothering) is hidden beneath the rubble. A character with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) score of 12 or higher notices the rug, but gets no hint that it is animated.

A search of the rubble and a successful DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check turns up an intact Aeorian robe (see “[Salsvault Features](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#SalsvaultFeatures)” at the beginning of this section).
