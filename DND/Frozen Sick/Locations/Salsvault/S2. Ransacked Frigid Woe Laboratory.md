> [!NOTE]
> Stone tables lie in pieces on the floor at the east end of the room. Two open stone chests stand against the west wall. A layer of fine sand coats the inside of the chests and the floor around them.

If the characters make any noise louder than a whisper in this chamber, the suits of animated armor in area S3 investigate the noise.

Any examination of the chests reveals that they are built into the floor. A character who examines the sand on the ground near the chest and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check notices two sets of dwarf-sized boot prints (from Orvo and Urgon) as well as two sets of boot prints made by human-sized feet (the animated armor from area S3).
