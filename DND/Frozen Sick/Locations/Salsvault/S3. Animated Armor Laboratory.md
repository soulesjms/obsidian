> Pieces of rusty plate armor are scattered about this chamber amid the rubble of destroyed stone furniture. An anvil built into the floor stands in front of a cold furnace to the southwest. Across the room from the furnace, two humanoid feet stick out from a pile of rubble.

Two suits of [animated armor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16786-animated-armor) normally stand guard in this chamber. If the armor didn’t leave to investigate disturbances in [areas S1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#S1EntranceChamber) or S2, both suits are here when the characters arrive, and you can add the following:

> Two full suits of steel armor stand upright but empty in the middle of the chamber, their gleaming surfaces a stark contrast to the rusty pieces lying nearby.

One of the blacksmiths who worked in this chamber was crushed by a stone table that broke into rubble when Salsvault crashed into Foren. Since then, the blacksmith has been a [zombie](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17077-zombie) [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) beneath the rubble and unable to break free. Any character who examines the feet notices them twitching with a successful DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check.

If the characters want to help the “victim” under the rubble, one character can remove enough rubble to free the zombie in 10 minutes. Multiple characters working together can reduce the time proportionately. As soon as it is freed, the zombie attacks.

The zombie wears an apron containing a set of damaged mithral smith’s tools (worth 50 gp).
