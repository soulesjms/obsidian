The door to this room is locked. When the characters can see into this area, read:

> [!NOTE]
> Broken blades, cracked hammers, frost-rotted spears, and other ruined weapons are spread out across the floor, fallen from the empty iron weapon racks that line the walls.

The mages of Salsvault stored animated weapons in this room, most of which were destroyed in the crash. Five [flying swords](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16865-flying-sword) lay among the debris, attacking any characters who enter.

The broken weapons on the floor make this area [difficult terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#DifficultTerrain). Any creature that falls [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone) in this room takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage.
