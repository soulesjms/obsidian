> [!NOTE]
> Four unmade beds are built into the east and west walls here, each with a footlocker tucked beneath it.

One of the footlockers holds an intact Aeorian robe (see “[Salsvault Features](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#SalsvaultFeatures)” at the beginning of this section).
