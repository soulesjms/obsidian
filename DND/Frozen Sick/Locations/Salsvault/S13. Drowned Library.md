> [!NOTE]
> Water ebbs and flows through a large opening along the east wall of this ruined library. Rotting parchments and waterlogged tomes are spread everywhere, fallen from cracked stone shelves.

The water is deeper than it appears beneath the ruined books and parchments, with the floor along the eastern side of the room having collapsed to a depth of 15 feet. A [giant octopus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16888-giant-octopus) hides here, having claimed this room as its lair. A character who succeeds on a Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check opposed by the octopus’s Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth)) check notices the beast. See “[Salsvault Features](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#SalsvaultFeatures),” earlier in this section, for the effects of entering the water.

A character with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) score of 12 or higher, or one who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check, notices a watertight scroll case floating in the water. The case holds two [spell scrolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5418-spell-scroll) of [detect magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic).
