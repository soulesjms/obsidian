If the iron lever in area S4 has been raised, read the following when the door to this room is opened:

> [!NOTE]
> A wave of heat hits you from the wall of roiling flame that fills this area, shooting down from the ceiling.

If the flames are off, read:

> [!NOTE]
> The only things to be seen in this room are eight chests built into the floor along the far wall.

If the flames are active, each creature that enters this area or starts its turn there must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

If the flames aren’t active, a character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check notes a faint oily smell in the room and notices pin-sized holes covering the ceiling.

Each chest is locked (see “[Salsvault Features](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#SalsvaultFeatures)” at the beginning of this section), packed with fine sand, and contains three vials of frigid woe (see the “[Vials of Frigid Woe](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#VialsofFrigidWoe)” sidebar earlier in this adventure).
