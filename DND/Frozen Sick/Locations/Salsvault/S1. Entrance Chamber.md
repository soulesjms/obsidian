### S1. Entrance Chamber

> [!NOTE]
> The heavy stone walls of this room dampen the cold and the howling wind outside. An inscription in what looks like Draconic runes is carved into the east wall.

The inscription is in an archaic version of Draconic that was spoken in ancient Aeor. It can be read by any character who can read Draconic with a few minutes of study, or by anyone with access to a [comprehend languages](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/comprehend-languages) spell or similar magic. The message reads: “Welcome to Salsvault! Visitors, please wait here for an escort, and DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING WITHOUT PERMISSION.”

If the characters make any noise louder than a whisper in this chamber, the suits of animated armor in [area S3](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#S3AnimatedArmorLaboratory) come to investigate.

The door that leads to [area S4](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#S4FrigidWoeLaboratory) is locked (see “[Salsvault Features](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#SalsvaultFeatures),” at the beginning of this section).

The door that leads to area S2 is slightly ajar. A character who examines the door and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation)) check notes that it was recently forced open (by Urgon and Orvo when they explored Salsvault).
