When the characters can see into this area, read:

> [!NOTE]
> Footlockers are tucked beneath four beds attached to the north and south walls. In the middle of the room, four zombies in tattered robes shuffle around, softly knocking into one another without caring.

The four [zombies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17077-zombie) attack as soon as they see intruders. The footlockers are empty.
