Salsvault’s crash into Foren destroyed the magic torches in this room, leaving it shrouded in darkness. When the characters can see into this area, read:

> [!NOTE]
> Iron pots, pans, utensils, and frost-covered food covers the floor of this kitchen. A steel stove is built into the west wall.

When the characters enter the room, four [animated kitchen knives](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/744300-animated-knife) fly up from the floor and attack. The knives are [flying swords](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16865-flying-sword), with these changes:

- Each knife is a Tiny construct with 12 (5d4) hit points and a challenge rating of 1/8 (25 XP).
- Instead of a longsword attack, each knife makes a melee attack (+4 to hit) that deals 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage on a hit.

Old frozen cheese, bread, meat, and produce cover the floor, all well rimed and inedible.
