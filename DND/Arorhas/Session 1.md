Summary for session 1:
Capital City Loatalice has 5 prominent buildings, a cathedral/castle, clocktower, treehouse-like stone tower, hodge-podge medieval skyscraper and (one other?)
The energetic elf Eluned arrived by boat to Loatalice and began exploring the city. Unknown to her, on that same boat was Warforged Castirion, who curiously arrived in a box and had a brief conversation with confused dock workers about whether he was cargo or a passenger. 
Rugged Human man Atlas arrived after walking for days finally arrived in Loatalice and felt a certain connection to the city. 
Evangeline arrived at the city looking for work. Talked to (local guards?) and said "I usually kill things for free"
Near Human Cat Hanna already living in the city was apprehensive to approach the adventurers guild. She talked with her friend Enoju who is a platinum badge member of the adventurers guild. She eventually mustered the courage to go inside to which she was greeted by the bartender and a brawl nearby between a bear-folk and a half-troll. Castirion arrived and asked the bartender about what the guild was. Shortly after this, Eluned, having just met a big friendly dire wolf jumped through the window and asked many of the same questions of the bartender about what the guild was and how it worked. 
Sister Lycoris arrived wearing black heavy armor accompanied by 4 mastiff hounds. 
Evangeline, sure of herself, walked up to the bartender and immediately asked for work. 
The party was now altogether in one room and was approached by the owner of the Dire wolf, and the guild (leader?) and told about a job to retrieve a magical artifact for a noble in town. The artifact was described as a hilt of a blade with a figurine with crossed arms over the chest attached. This artifact had been stolen by bandits and were camping north of Loatalice. The party was offered 175g each for the artifact. 

After some brief conversation and pie, the party left to gather some supplies for their Journey. Eluned, Hanna, and Castirion went to get a Pike from the blacksmith, passing by the magic shop "mage you look" which apparently is owned by Hanna's Mother. They proceeded to the apothecary, where both Castirion and Hanna broke a number of potions while perusing the messy storefront. Hanna and Castirion were not able to pay for said potions, and were told Hanna's mother would pay. They retrieved the health potions they needed and left. 

While the party travelled northward, they came across a cave. After some inspection, they found some curious runes on the top of the cave entrance written in primordial. Within the cave, Hanna's owl discovered a wonderous bag of creation. This bag allowed party members to grab a magical object from within once per day with a wide variety of results. 

The party discovered a ransacked cart and two dead bodies. They stealthily approached the nearby bandit camp and decided to engage with Atlas magically lowering the watchtower. Combat ensued with a number of missed shots from Sister Lycoris, surprisingly strong bandit captain, and a frustrated bandit leader unable to hit wizard Eluned. Bandits one by one were eventually defeated, all except one who surrendered and told the party exactly where to find the magical artifact. The artifact was quickly found by Eluned, and after she touched the artifact, disappeared.
