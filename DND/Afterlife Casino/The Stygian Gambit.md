The Stygian Gambit
An Adventure for 2nd-Level Characters
At the Afterlife Casino, a three-dragon ante tournament called the Grand Minauros Invitational awards one winner with a sizable purse and a golden erinyes statuette. A former gambler with a score
to settle hires the characters to steal the statuette as well as gold from the casino's vault before the tournament ends and the winner is declared. The characters must case the casino, steal what they
came for, and escape.

Adventure Background

A skilled three-dragon ante player and a shrewd tiefling entrepreneur, Verity Kye toured the gambling circuit for years, making a name for herself and winning numerous large tournaments.
While on the circuit, Verity met a gnome gambler named Quentin Togglepocket. The two hit it off, and they formed a plan to save enough winnings to open their own casino. Just as they seemed
poised to put their plan in action, Quentin disappeared, taking all their money with him—only to resurface years later, having built the Afterlife Casino using the stolen money.
Now, Verity needs the characters to break into the vault at the Afterlife Casino, steal the erinyes statuette meant to be the prize for the casino's three-dragon ante tournament, and retrieve her share
of the money from the vault. For Verity, it's not the money or the statuette that matters—it's ensuring that Quentin's betrayal comes back to haunt him, and that he knows the person he betrayed
made him pay.
Using the Golden Vault
If you're using the Golden Vault as a patron, a golden key is delivered to the characters in whatever manner you deem fit. When the characters use this key to open their music box, the lid pops open
and a soothing voice says the following:
"Greetings, operatives. An ally of the Golden Vault named Verity Kye had her life's savings stolen from her by a devious gambling partner. We've found an opportunity to right this wrong.
This quest, should you choose to undertake it, requires you to infiltrate the Afterlife Casino and steal a statuette and a sum of money. Meet with Verity at the Brine Widow tavern to learn
more details. Good luck, operatives."
Closing the music box causes the golden key to vanish.
Starting the Adventure
The characters start this adventure at the Brine Widow, a local pub near the water, having received directions from the Golden Vault (see above) or a mysterious invitation to discuss an "advantageous
opportunity" with someone named Verity Kye, who waits for them in the Brine Widow's back room.
Roleplaying Verity Kye
Verity Kye is bold, confident, and genuinely kind—though not always nice. Quentin's betrayal cut her two ways—the deception from a potential business partner hurt, but such treachery from
someone she called a friend was unforgivable.
Verity has little patience for cheats and liars (card-table deception notwithstanding). Though she has no expectation of total honesty from the characters, blatant deception or an attempt to
double-cross her quickly earns her ire.
At the Brine Widow
Verity Kye (neutral good, tiefling spy) sits patiently at a table in the back room and makes small talk with the characters if they arrive in ones and twos. Once all the characters have arrived, Verity asks
the last to enter to close the door.
To begin this scene, read the following text:
The back room in the Brine Widow is well appointed, with a polished wood table, paintings of local landscapes, and wrought-iron lanterns. Platters on the table are piled with food, and a
pot of tea steams in the center of the table.
The tiefling before you has red skin, cobalt-blue eyes, and curly white hair she wears in long twists. Black horns rise from her forehead in tight spirals.
"Thank you for accepting my invitation. I'm Verity Kye, and what I'm about to discuss with you requires the utmost secrecy. I can't stress to you enough how important it is that you speak
nothing of what you hear within these four walls."
Once Verity gets assurances from the characters that they will keep quiet about her mission, she tells them about the job:
"The Afterlife Casino is a new Nine Hells–themed attraction just outside town. The owner, Quentin Togglepocket, built it using prize money he stole from me, and I'd like you to give him
hell. He's hosting a tournament there. I want you to steal the erinyes statuette he plans to award as a prize, embarrassing him in front of the big names at the tournament. I also want you to
steal back the five thousand gold pieces he stole from me. Bring the statuette and the gold here, where I'll be waiting for you."
Verity can provide the characters with transportation, a rough map of the casino (see "Verity's Map" below), and a bag of holding for transporting the loot. She offers to pay the characters 100 gp
apiece and cedes any claim on additional coin or items they acquire within the casino. A character who negotiates the reward and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check
gets her to raise the payment to 150 gp apiece.

The characters have just over 48 hours to steal the erinyes statuette, as the tournament ends two nights from now and the statuette will depart with the winner. While the characters could try to take
the statuette from the winner on their way out, Verity wants to limit the heist's impact to Quentin as much as possible to shame him publicly.
Verity's Bag of Holding
Made of purple fabric with red stitching, Verity's bag of holding functions the same as a standard bag of holding in every way but one: to remove any items from the bag, the holder must say the
command word, "hyacinth." Verity's custom bag was given to her by a friend after Verity won her first professional tournament (ironically enough, the tournament where she defeated Quentin).
When Verity gives the party the bag of holding, she doesn't provide them with the command word.
Verity's Map
The map Verity gives to the characters is a hand-drawn floor plan of the casino and the employee-only areas, as shown in map 2.1. Verity paid Gildur Draak, a dwarf who worked for the cons truction
company that built the casino, to provide her with information about the building's nonpublic areas. However, Verity is no artist, so the map's accuracy is questionable.

What Verity Knows about the Casino
Verity can give the characters a few ideas about what to expect, but she hasn't been to the casino herself, so she can't provide details. She tells the characters the following information:
Arrival Wooden boats shuttle visitors and personnel to and from the casino, which is built inside a cavern. The boats ply the river that leads to the cavern. (Verity knows no other way to enter the
casino.)
Employees The casino employs tieflings only.
Employee-Only Areas Doors to employee-only areas have bright-green trim and are magically locked. Getting into them might require the characters to obtain an employee pass card, which
bypasses the magical locks.
Security Mirrors Magical security mirrors throughout the casino (marked on Verity's map with red icons) project what they reflect onto twin mirrors in the security office (area A16).

The Prize The gold coins and the erinyes statuette are kept in the vault. (Verity is not entirely correct. The coins are in the vault, but the statuette is on display in area A9, where the tournament
takes place.)
Getting Caught
If one or more characters are caught trying to steal from the casino, security guards attempt to apprehend them. Captured characters are taken to the holding cells (area A17). Quentin visits
them an hour later. If the characters reveal they're working for Verity Kye, the gnome laughs and makes them a counteroffer (see area A14 for details). If the characters refuse his counteroffer,
Quentin has them tossed out of the casino and sent up the river in a gondola.
Planning the Heist
How the characters execute the heist is up to them. Allow your players to flex their creativity.
The characters would be smart to scout the casino and learn as much as they can about the layout, personnel, and security arrangements before perpetrating the heist. They can also try to acquire
employee uniforms and pass cards.
Disguises
Dealers, bartenders, and other floor employees wear sleek uniforms that consist of black tuxedo pants and red jackets with thin lapels. The characters might try to steal the uniforms to disguise
themselves as new hires. The easiest approach would be to snatch uniforms from the laundry (area A7).
Since all casino employees are tieflings, non-tiefling characters who wish to disguise themselves as employees will need disguise kits or appropriate magic to perpetrate the deception.
Whenever a disguised character enters a situation where the disguise might be detected by an onlooker who takes more than a passing interest in the character, have the character make a Charisma
(Deception) check. If the check's total is higher than the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of the onlooker, the disguise does its job. If the check fails, the onlooker sees through the disguise and
either alerts security or demands a small bribe (5 gp) to keep silent.
Employee Pass Cards
Every casino employee carries a pass card made of green metal and embossed with a devil's smiling, winking visage. A detect magic spell reveals a faint aura of abjuration magic around the card.
Anyone in possession of a pass card can open any locked door in the casino, bypassing the arcane lock spell on the door.
As an action, a character within reach of an employee can attempt to steal that employee's pass card, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If the check fails by 5 or
more, the employee notices the botched theft and cries for help. Otherwise, a failed check goes unnoticed.
The Afterlife Casino
The Afterlife Casino lies three miles north of the nearest town. It's an architectural marvel built into a natural cavern carved by a river nicknamed the River Styx. Since the real River Styx is a route to
the afterlife, Quentin Togglepocket named his establishment the Afterlife Casino.
After passing through the casino, the river pours over a waterfall into a larger body of water (which could be a lake or an ocean, depending on where you set the adventure). The waterfall isn't a safe
way to enter or leave the casino.
Arriving at the Casino
The characters can take the carriage offered to them by Verity or find their own way to the casino. At a branch in the road, they see a freshly painted and lacquered sign declaring, "This way to the
Afterlife!" in gaudy, gold lettering, with an arrow pointing down the narrower branch. Characters who follow this route for a short distance come to a cobbled turnaround and lot where carriage
drivers can wait while their patrons gamble.
As the characters step from the carriage, they are greeted by a red-robed tiefling commoner who welcomes them to the Afterlife Casino. This tiefling directs them down a brightly lit row of docks,
where boats wait to take the characters downriver. The casino's entrance is visible a short distance away, where the river enters a wide-mouthed cave.
Boat Ride
A tiefling ferrier (commoner) in a heavy, hooded robe waits silently to convey characters to the casino.
The ferrier plays the part of Charon on the real River Styx. The tiefling keeps their hood up at all times and doesn't speak to passengers. If the characters touch the ferrier or attempt to pull back the
ferrier's hood, the ferrier breaks character and asks the characters to stop—the tiefling is just trying to do their job.
When the characters enter the casino for the first time, read the following:
The ferrier ably navigates your boat downriver and into an underground channel. As the cave mouth swallows you, you hear music over the echo of a distant waterfall.
The cave's ceiling rises high above your heads, and dancing lights bob around hanging stalactites. The river winds through the casino floor, splitting the cavernous chamber in two and
passing under arched stone bridges at various points. Card tables and other gaming stations surrounded by chattering patrons fill the open space. A cheer rises from deeper in the cavern,
which is decorated to suggest excitement, opportunity, and excess.
The ferrier steers your boat toward the left bank, and your boat rocks as it bumps up against a wooden dock. The ferrier then raises one hand, gesturing at the glittering sights before you,
and intones in a deep, raspy voice: "Welcome to the Afterlife. Temptation awaits."
The characters can leave the boat and freely explore what the casino has to offer. Any character who tips the ferrier with two coins gains inspiration.
Casino Features
The Afterlife Casino is built within a natural cavern. Its common features are described in the following sections.
Cashier Stations
The casino has four cashier's stations (in areas A2 and A4), where tiefling cashiers (commoners) in smiling devil masks make change or trade out cash for chips. The casino's chips are thin, painted
wooden disks. Stamped on both sides of every chip is the casino's emblem: a golden pitchfork.
A cashier has no cash on hand but is attuned to a magical sigil on the station's countertop. The cashier places coinage on the sigil, sending it directly to the vault, or pulls coins from the vault through
the same sigil. Withdrawals of more than 250 gp require a second cashier to confirm the transaction. Transactions occurring through the sigils are automatically recorded in the magical ledger in the
clerk's office (area A15).
Ceilings
The ceiling in the public parts of the casino is 50 feet high and festooned with hanging stalactites. The ceilings in the employee-only areas are 20 feet high and smooth.
Doors

The casino's interior doors are made of wood. Arcane lock spells have been cast on the doors that lead to the employee-only areas, the vault hallway, and the vault itself. These doors have bright-
green trim, making them obvious to visitors. (On map 2.2, these doors are marked with dots to indicate they are locked.)

Casino personnel use pass cards (see "Employee Pass Cards" earlier in the adventure) to bypass the arcane lock spells on the doors, which can be shouldered open with a DC 25 Strength (Athletics)
check.
Employee-Only Areas
Entering an employee-only area requires a pass card (see "Employee Pass Cards" earlier in the adventure).

Security guards who encounter unauthorized individuals in employee-only areas immediately try to usher them out. If those individuals resist, the guards attempt to apprehend the intruders and take
them to the holding cells (area A17).
Lights and Music
The casino is lit by programmed dancing lights spells that create flames of a hellish hue. These lights float and bob at varying heights. The employee tunnels contain continual flame spells cast on
sconces.
The music that plays throughout the casino is illusory and sounds a lot like cowboy country music. The music plays more softly in employee-only areas.
Security Guards
Five tiefling security guards (use the thug stat block) patrol the casino floor, and a sixth stands next to the display case containing the erinyes statuette (in area A9). If the characters cause a ruckus,
the nearest guard moves toward them and tries to quell the disturbance without resorting to violence. If attacked, the guard reacts in kind and shouts for reinforcements. All other guards arrive in 3
rounds.
Security Mirrors
Throughout the casino are security mirrors, each one anchored to a wall at a downward angle twelve feet off the floor. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of divination magic around each mirror,
which is a Large object with AC 13, 5 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. In addition to functioning as a normal mirror, each security mirror acts as a magical scrying device,
allowing guards in the security office (area A16) to see through it like a window. Casting dispel magic on a security mirror suppresses its scrying property for 10 minutes.
Breaking a mirror or suppressing its magic leads two guards from area A16 to investigate and report what they learn to Quentin.
Walls and Floors
The casino's perimeter walls are made of rough, naturally carved stone. Interior walls are made of 2-foot-thick stone; these walls look natural but were sculpted using stone shape spells. The floors are
made of smooth worked stone and are covered with garish rugs.
Cheating
A patron who is caught cheating is escorted by 1d3 security guards (use the thug stat block) to the holding cells (area A17). The cheater is released the next dawn, escorted by security to a boat,
advised never to return, and sent upriver.
Games of Chance
The casino has many diversions for its patrons to enjoy, the most popular being games of chance.
Three-Dragon Ante
Three-dragon ante is a card game. If you own an actual three-dragon ante deck, you can play the card game for real. Otherwise, adjudicate the outcome of a three-dragon ante game using d12s and
the following rules:
Step 1 Randomly determine which participant is the dealer.
Step 2 Each participant (including the dealer) places their opening bet, then rolls five d12s to determine their hand, keeping these die rolls hidden from the other participants.
Step 3 Starting to the left of the dealer and continuing clockwise, each participant reveals one of their die rolls. This step is repeated twice more; on the second and third round, each participant
can raise their bet before revealing their next die roll. The other participants each have three options: match the bet, raise their bet (in which case all participants must match that bet in turn), or
fold, forfeiting any bet they've placed and dropping out of the game.
Step 4 Each participant who hasn't folded totals their die rolls. The one with the highest total wins. The winner becomes the dealer for the next game (assuming the participant wants to keep
playing).
Life and Death
Life and death is a dice game played between the house (represented by a dealer) and a player. While up to five players can sit at a table, their only opponent is the house.
To play, each player places a bet; once bets have been placed, the house and the players each roll a d20. If a player rolls lower than the dealer, the house wins. A player who rolls higher than the
dealer reclaims the money they bet and wins that same amount from the house.
War. A player who ties with the house has two options: the player can surrender and lose half their bet, or the player can "go to war," in which case the player must double their bet, and then the
player and dealer both roll again.
Push Your Luck. When a player wins a roll of life and death, they can opt to push their luck on their next bet. In this case, they bet everything they won on the last roll (their ante plus the winnings
from the house). If they win, the house pays double their bet.
Copper Slots
These machines, referred to by some casino patrons as "tricky devils," are simple clockwork devices that accept copper coins. Each machine has a spring-loaded lever and five identical spinning
cylinders called reels. Six golden, Infernal runes are painted on each reel. A player inserts between 1 and 9 copper coins into the machine's slot and pulls the lever, which causes the reels to spin, stop,
and display a row of five runes. The player wins by matching three or more runes.
To determine the result of a pull, have the player roll 5d6 (the dice represent the five reels of Infernal runes). The player's goal is to roll as many of the same number on the dice as possible. The
payout, if any, varies according to the results, as shown in the Copper Slots Payouts table.
Copper Slots Payouts
5d6 Result Payout
Three of a kind 2-to-1
Four of a kind 4-to-1
Five of a kind 10-to-1

Quentin Togglepocket
Quentin Togglepocket (lawful evil, gnome noble) has a Mephistophelian aspect to his appearance. He dresses garishly, slicks back his wavy hair, curls his mustache, and cultivates a long, pointy beard.
Only the freckles across his nose undermine his devilish countenance.
Quentin used to be a professional three-dragon ante player, but his rise to prominence was cut short ten years ago when, in a major tournament, he lost the final gambit (and the entire prize) to a
relative newcomer: a young tiefling named Verity Kye.
Quentin never forgave Verity for what he felt was a stunning humiliation and vowed to take his revenge. He spent the next several years building up a false friendship with her, traveling the gambling
circuit with her and cultivating a mutual dream: owning and operating their own casino. Then, three years ago, he saw his opportunity, stole all the money they had pooled together, and vanished
from Verity's life. Opening the Afterlife Casino was the final coup de grace in Quentin's vengeance against Verity, and he is riding high on the grand-opening weekend. He secretly hopes Verity arrives
to confront him herself so he can laugh in her face.
Quentin couldn't have accomplished his goals alone. To make his casino a reality, he sold his soul to Mammon, the archdevil of Minauros (the third layer of the Nine Hells). In turn, one of Mammon's
subordinates put Quentin in touch with wizards who could help him build and decorate the casino.
Roleplaying Quentin
Quentin sees himself as Verity's victim and portrays himself as a martyr for losing to her. He sees the theft and his new casino as his rightful chance to even the scales and reclaim his dignity.
Quentin is a classic villain, happy to monologue if given the chance—how will the characters know how brilliant he is otherwise?
Quentin's Location
You decide where Quentin is at any given time. If he's not chatting with patrons or boosting staff morale on the casino floor, he's usually in his office (area A14). He also visits the holding cells (area
A17) to question patrons who have been detained by security.
Casino Patrons
The Afterlife Casino is bustling with patrons from all parts of the world. Roll or pick randomly from the Casino Patrons table when you need a patron.
Casino Patrons
d6 Patron
1 Lysa Silvertongue (neutral, tiefling noble) is eager to break the monotony of her life of leisure.
2 Georgie Simmons (neutral good, human commoner) is a down-and-out loser who is determined to have a good time.
3 Karlton Keyes(lawful neutral, human commoner), a merchant, hopes to open his own casino and is here doing research.
4 Lowell Brassborn (neutral good, dwarf commoner) thinks gambling is a waste of money but is here with his sister, Lorna.
5 Lorna Brassborn (lawful neutral, dwarf commoner) is a hard-nosed copper slots player who thinks she has the machines' algorithms figured out.
6 Rythil Ire (chaotic neutral, elf noble) aims to enjoy the cocktails at Bar Malbolge and soak away his stress in the spa.
Afterlife Casino Locations
The casino is divided into nine areas of gaming and entertainment. The north end of the casino ends in an 80-foot rocky cliff face. The river that runs through the casino pours over the cliff at the
overlook (area A10) and empties into a larger body of water below.
The following locations are keyed to map 2.2.

A1: Docking Area
The casino's boats load and unload passengers at a pair of wooden docks. Two tiefling attendants (commoners) help patrons into and out of the boats.
Patrons are expected to abide by the casino's rules, which are posted on placards near the docks. The placards read as follows:
Rules in the Afterlife:
Stay out of the River Styx.
Don't cheat. (Cheaters never prosper.)
Don't accost or threaten other patrons or the staff.

Keep your weapons hidden or sheathed at all times.
Only employees may pass through
green-trimmed doors.
WIN, WIN, WIN!
A2: Avernus
This area holds three-dragon ante tables and copper slot machines. Just south of the game tables are two cashier booths. Just north of the games area is a secluded lounge that holds a small bar as
well as chairs and couches.
Security Mirrors. A security mirror hangs in the southeast corner overlooking the games area. Another security mirror hangs on the north wall, above the chairs in the lounge area.
A3: Dis
This section contains rows of copper slot machines and five life and death tables, each with a different bet value: 1 cp, 5 cp, 1 sp, 1 gp, and 10 gp.
A4: Minauros
A narrow racing track dominates the center of this section, with shouting and cheering patrons clustered around it. Numbered rats scurry along their respective lanes. As the rats cross the
finish line, cries of victory and groans of defeat erupt from the patrons. Just south of the track are a pair of lounge chairs and two cashier booths staffed by tieflings wearing devil masks.
Security Mirrors. A security mirror overlooks the cashier booths in the southwest corner. Another security mirror hangs in the northwest corner of this area, overlooking the track.
A5: Bar Malbolge
Bar Malbolge features two bars and plenty of plush, comfortable chairs and cushions. The tiefling bartenders (commoners) serve spirits and a bitter ale called Brimstone Gulp. This ale is served in
copper flagons embossed with prancing imps. Patrons can also buy cigars here for 1 cp each.
Security Mirror. A security mirror in the northwest corner of this area faces the northernmost bar and seating area.
A6: Phlegethosian Spa & Stygian Baths
The air in here is warmer and more humid than in the casino proper and bears a sulfurous fragrance. A tiefling seated behind a desk gives you a warm smile. Chintz curtains are drawn
behind her.
"Dear souls," says the tiefling. "Care to enjoy a massage, relax in our sauna, or take a warm bath?"
The tiefling attendant (commoner) is happy to schedule massages or time in the sauna or baths. Patrons are allowed to explore the areas beyond the curtain:
Phlegethosian Spa The northernmost chamber is where patrons receive therapeutic massages (10 gp for an hour) or relax in the wood-sided sauna for free. A locked double door in the east wall
leads to the laundry (area A7).
Stygian Baths The southernmost room contains four steaming pools of water. Patrons can pay 2 gp for two hours in the pools or 5 gp for an all-day pass.
A7: Laundry
Employee-Only Area
This area holds two large washtubs, as well as a clothesline hung with towels and employee uniforms. Characters who want to disguise themselves as employees can find plenty of uniforms here.
A8: Cirque Maladomini
Cirque Maladomini performs here for the enjoyment of all. Hour-long performances occur here once every four hours. Each show presents a mix of tiefling acrobats and trained animals, all
performing to the music of a tiefling banjo player. The star of the show is a trained lion named Emrys, which leaps through flaming hoops on command. See area A12 for more information about
these creatures.
Casino patrons come and go through two sets of double doors in the east wall. Descending rings of seats encircle a 35-foot-wide, 10-foot-deep depression in the floor. When the circus is in full
swing, performers and trained animals enter and leave through an open tunnel in the west wall of the depression. This tunnel leads to a staging area (area A12) behind a locked double door.
Security Mirror. A security mirror hangs in the northwest corner, overlooking the seating area.
A9: Cania
Steps lead to the sunken floor of a gambling haven ringed with pillars of black basalt. Seven three-dragon ante tables take up the floorspace. A three-foot-high shelf carved into the far wall
bears a glass case, displayed in which is a gold statuette of a winged devil. Standing next to the display case is a tiefling security guard.
The five tables closest to the entrance are high-stakes tables (50 gp buy-in) open to anyone, while the easternmost two tables are reserved for the final rounds of the Grand Minauros Invitational
tournament.
Grand Minauros Invitational. When the characters first arrive here, the tournament is in full swing. Its eight remaining participants (see the "Tournament Participants" sidebar) are arranged as shown
in the Tournament Seating table. Between rounds of the tournament, characters are free to mingle and chat with the tournament participants.

Tournament Participants
Eight card sharks have come to participate in the Grand Minauros Invitational tournament. Use the noble stat block to represent them, but assume they are unarmed and unarmored. Their
names and descriptions are as follows:
Anaïs Bellefleur (chaotic good tiefling) smokes foul-smelling cigars, has a bellowing laugh, and enjoys ale a bit too much.
Jetta Moore (neutral good human) has childlike enthusiasm and displays guileless naiveté.
Karn Ironpebble (lawful neutral dwarf) grumbles to himself, counts cards, and is deliberately slow at playing his hands.

Lahdia Mizreem (neutral drow) is aloof, inscrutable, and fiercely determined to win.
Nightshade (lawful good tiefling) finds the theme of the casino distasteful but is willing to overlook it to win the purse.
Ruthie Swifford (neutral good human) is a determined, no-nonsense player who keeps up a constant stream of good-natured chatter.
Whipp Walsh (chaotic neutral human) is a charming rake and a sore loser.
Wumpus Thistledown (lawful evil halfling) dislikes playing high bets and is condescending.
Barring character intervention, the tournament participants are eliminated in the following order: Wumpus Thistledown, Anaïs Bellefleur, Whipp Walsh, Jetta Moore, Karn Ironpebble, Nightshade,
and Ruthie Swifford. That leaves Lahdia Mizreem as the winner.
Security Guard and Display Case. A tiefling security guard (use the thug stat block) stands next to the display case and allows guests to examine the statuette without touching the case.
The display case is 2 feet wide, 2 feet deep, and 3 feet tall, and it weighs 25 pounds. It is a Small object that has AC 13, 3 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The erinyes statuette
is a Tiny object that weighs 9 pounds.
A character who examines the display case and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check spots a line of barely visible runes inscribed around the perimeter of each pane of glass. A detect
magic spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic emanating from these runes. Damaging the case triggers a magical trap that forces each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the case to
succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute.
The front of the display case is a hinged door with a locked latch. The door can be unlocked and opened using the key found in Quentin's office (area A14). As an action, a character using thieves'
tools can try to pick the lock, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.
Security Mirror. A security mirror hangs on a pillar in the southwest corner, overlooking the room.
A10: Waterfall Overlook
The casino floor ends where the river spills over the edge of a cliff and into a much larger body of water. The waterfall is thunderous, drowning out the noise from the casino. Above the
waterfall is a stone overlook bounded by three-foot-high railings.
The waterfall is 100 feet tall and plunges into water that is 30 feet deep.
Security Mirror. A security mirror is mounted in the northeast corner, overlooking the area.
A11: Nessus
Nessus is a restaurant located 20 feet below the casino. It can be reached by descending a spiral staircase in the hallway between areas A6 and A9.
The restaurant's dining area sits on a ledge behind the waterfall (area A10). The ceiling here is uneven but is roughly 12 feet high. A smooth wall separates the dining area from the kitchen, which
contains two large stoves.
The restaurant is open all day and offers the following menu of options:
Nessus—Menu
Appetizers
Seasonal pan-fried fungi with garlic butter • 2 cp
Spicy shredded stirge sliders • 3 cp
Main Dishes
Abyssal chicken egg omelet • 1 sp
Otto's irresistible noodles • 5 cp
Otyugh steak, well done • 3 sp
Desserts & Drinks
Night hag's delight (blackberry tart) • 2 cp
Stench kow cheese plate • 2 cp
Nessian liqueur • 2 cp
Coffee/tea • 1 cp (first cup is complimentary!)
Security Mirror. A security mirror hangs on the southeast wall, just north of the entry tunnel, overlooking the dining room.
A12: Staging Area and Animal Cages
Employee-Only Area
Cirque Maladomini uses this room as a holding pen for animals and a staging area for performers. Characters entering from the south must descend a flight of steps to reach the chamber's sunken
floor.
When the characters enter this room for the first time, read the following:
This room smells like hay and musk. Three crates rest on the floor in one corner, and a portable cage on rollers sits beside them. Floor-to-ceiling bars form two larger cages against the
north wall. A wooden chest sits against the east wall near the biggest cage. Resting on the lid of the chest is a ring of keys.
A locked double door in the middle of the east wall conceals a curvy tunnel that leads to area A8.
When Cirque Maladomini isn't performing in area A8, the northwest cage holds three trained baboons that shriek whenever someone new enters the room, and the northeast cage contains a quiet
trained lion named Emrys. Three tiefling acrobats (commoners with Acrobatics +4 and Performance +4) are also rehearsing together in the middle of the room. One tiefling performs a one-handed
handstand, while another twirls a flaming hoop, and the third plucks a banjo. During performances, the tieflings and the animals are all absent.
Wooden Chest. The wooden chest next to the lion's cage is unlocked. The keys on the chest unlock the doors to the animal cages. The chest itself contains juggling pins, rubber balls, colorful
streamers, and other circus doodads. A potion of animal friendship can be found here as well.
A13: Employee Lounge
Employee-Only Area
This room is sixty feet long by fifty feet wide. A long table surrounded by ten chairs takes up the center of the room, and the far corners each hold a couch, two cushioned chairs, and a
coffee table.
At any time during casino hours, three tiefling employees (commoners) are here on a break.
The off-duty employees are chatty and not overly fond of their employer. Characters who question the tieflings can learn the following information:
Minotaur Skeleton Quentin recently added a new security measure to the casino's vault: an animated minotaur skeleton. Quentin refers to it as "Virgil." It can be controlled using a magic rod
that Quentin keeps in his office (area A14).

Security Office Personnel Three guards staff the security office across the hall.
A14: Quentin's Office
Employee-Only Area
This roomy office contains an L-shaped desk sized for a gnome, cushioned chairs, and knickknacks on shelves. A painted bas-relief spans the entire north wall and depicts a host of winged
devils catching mortals as they plunge into the depths of hell.
If Quentin Togglepocket is in his office and notices one or more of the characters, add the following:
A garishly dressed gnome with a devilish countenance to rival Mephistopheles sits behind the desk, stroking his pointy beard. When he notices you, he curls his lips in a lopsided smile.
"Well, now," he says. "What can I do for you?"
Quentin (lawful evil, gnome noble) shrewdly shuns combat, but he draws his rapier and defends himself if threatened and cornered. As an action, he can utter a prayer to Mammon, which causes two
spined devils to magically emerge from the bas-relief on the north wall. Each devil appears in an unoccupied space next to the north wall, acts as Quentin's ally, and sticks around for 1 minute before
returning to the Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells. If the devils are defeated, Quentin shouts for help, attracting the three security guards from area A16 if they haven't already been dealt
with.
Ain't Foolin' No One. Quentin personally hires all casino staff and knows all their names. Consequently, he isn't fooled by characters pretending to be employees he doesn't know.
Quentin's Counteroffer. If the characters come clean to Quentin, he is amused to hear that Verity hired them to rob his casino. He refuses to give the characters what they came for, instead offering to
pay them 150 gp each to forgo the heist and return to Verity with a letter from him.
If the characters agree to his terms, Quentin writes a quick letter, slides it into an envelope, and hands it to them with their payment before leading them back to the casino floor. In addition, he gives
each of them a handful of casino chips equivalent to 15 gp.
Quentin's letter to Verity reads as follows:
It is such a disappointment when one attempts to conceal their lack of skill by sending others to do their dirty work. Nevertheless, after all this time, it appears I am, in fact, better than you.
—Q.
Desk Drawers. The top drawer of Quentin's desk holds a red candle, a quill, a jar of ink, a few sheets of parchment, a few envelopes, a tiny glass key that unlocks the display case in area A9, a copper
ring bearing Quentin's wax seal, and a velvet pouch containing 25 gp.
The bottom drawer of Quentin's desk contains an unlocked wooden case that contains a 12-inch-long rod made of bone with a stylized copper minotaur head mounted at each end of it. A detect
magic spell reveals an aura of enchantment magic emanating from the rod. As an action, the holder of the rod can use it to telepathically command the minotaur skeleton in area A19, provided the
rod is within 30 feet of it. The minotaur skeleton follows such commands to the best of its ability. If the minotaur skeleton ever leaves the casino, it goes berserk and can't be controlled by any one,
and the rod turns to dust.
Treasure. Quentin wears nine gem-inlaid gold rings (100 gp each) on his fingers and keeps an employee pass card in his waistcoat pocket (see "Employee Pass Cards" earlier in the adventure).
A15: Clerk's Office
Employee-Only Area
This office contains an L-shaped desk, atop which sits a candlestick and a thick, open ledger. Other furnishings include cushioned chairs and two bare bookshelves.
The ledger on the desk magically tracks all money moving in and out of the casino. Every coin and chip that passes through the cashier booths is recorded here in the appropriate column, scrawled in
ink as if by some invisible hand. Any character who spends 1 minute reading the ledger can verify that the casino's vault contains roughly 5,000 gp in coinage.
A16: Security Office
Employee-Only Area
Five desks face the west wall, which is covered with mirrors. Each mirror on the wall corresponds to a security mirror elsewhere in the casino, and whatever is happening within line of sight of the
mirrors is displayed here. Three tiefling security guards (thugs) monitor the mirrors.
Ring of Keys. A ring of eight keys dangles from a hook next to the south door. Each cell and chest in area A17 has a corresponding key that unlocks it.
A17: Holding Cells
Employee-Only Area
This area holds six jail cells and two padlocked wooden chests (see "Wooden Chests" below). The keys in the security office (area A16) unlock the cells and the chests. As an action, a character using
thieves' tools can try to pick a lock, doing so with a successful DC 17 Dexterity check. If the character tries to pick the lock of a cell door from inside the cell, the check is made with disadvantage.
Wooden Chests. Both chests are unlocked and empty. If one or more characters are detained here, their weapons are locked in the chests for safekeeping.
A18: Back Hallways
Employee-Only Area
These three hallways are used frequently by casino employees. At your discretion, characters who linger here might encounter one or more of these employees heading to or from the casino floor.
Security Mirrors. Each hallway has a security mirror on its west wall that faces a single or double door to the east.
A19: Vault
Employee-Only Area
The double door leading to the vault has cast-iron devil faces mounted on its south side. If a creature without an employee pass card comes within 10 feet of the double door, the devil faces open
their mouths and breathe a 10-foot-wide, 30-foot-long line of fire down the hallway. Each creature in the line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one. This trap resets at the next dawn.
When the characters peer into the vault for the first time, read the following:
The vault is forty feet deep and almost twice as wide. A security mirror stares back at you from the far wall. Seven treasure chests rest on low tables positioned against the north and east
walls, and two tall wardrobes stand against the south wall.
Standing in the middle of the room is the animated skeleton of a minotaur.
Virgil the minotaur skeleton stands guard in the center of the room. Virgil attacks any intruders who aren't escorted by Quentin. A character who has Quentin's magic rod (see area A14) can use it to
telepathically command Virgil.
Iron Chests. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around each iron chest. All seven chests are magically linked to the cashier stations in the casino. The interior of each chest's
lid is scribed with a rune that enables the cashiers to remotely deposit coins into and withdraw coins from the chests. The chests must be closed for their magic to function, and the chests become
nonmagical if removed from the vault.
At any given time, the seven chests contain mixed coinage worth a total of 2d4 × 1,000 gp.
If all the coins are removed from the chests, the cashiers quickly discover they are unable to withdraw money from the vault and alert the guards immediately. It's only a matter of time until someone
investigates.
Security Mirror. A security mirror hangs on the north wall of the vault, facing the double door.

Wardrobes. The wardrobes hold items of value given by rich patrons for collateral against the house: a gold and ruby necklace (250 gp), a jade rabbit figurine (75 gp), and a +1 rapier.
Conclusion
The adventure ends when the characters return to Verity Kye with the fruits of their heist, Quentin's letter, or nothing:
Returning with the Loot If the characters obtained the statuette and the money and return both to Verity Kye, she is pleased. She pays the characters and thanks them for their service.
Returning Empty-Handed If the characters return empty-handed, Verity is disappointed but open to the possibility of giving them more opportunities to prove themselves, if they're game for it.
Returning with Quentin's Letter If the characters return without the loot but give Quentin's letter to Verity, she reads it in furious silence. She then tells the characters to leave and offers them no
recompense.
For the Golden Vault
If the characters accomplish the heist for the Golden Vault, Verity ensures that the Golden Vault learns about the characters' success. She also informs the characters that they are entitled to an
uncommon magic item of their choice (subject to your approval) as payment for the statuette. The item is delivered to the characters the next day.
