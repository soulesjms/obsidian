The casino's boats load and unload passengers at a pair of wooden docks. Two tiefling attendants ([commoners](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#commoner_mm)) help patrons into and out of the boats.

Patrons are expected to abide by the casino's rules, which are posted on placards near the docks. The placards read as follows:

#### Rules in the Afterlife:

> Don't accost or threaten other patrons or the staff.
> 
> Keep your weapons hidden or sheathed at all times.
